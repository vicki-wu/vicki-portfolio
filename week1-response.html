          Something I found interesting about this presentation is the author's
          approach to web development as a journey of self-expression, rather
          than just a technical exercise. When I create websites, I tend to
          focus on the technical aspects such as creating fancy designs, rather
          than the content itself. After reading through the presentation, I
          noticed how simple the presentation was (how it was only made through
          HTML/CSS), yet I found it to be very impressive. I now agree with the
          author's perspective, particularly their emphasis on content over
          flashy features and the idea of websites being in "perpetual beta."
          This view encourages continuous learning and improvement, which is
          valuable in both web development and personal growth. The author's
          advice to focus on self-satisfaction rather than social media
          validation is also notable, as it promotes a healthier approach to
          creativity. This presentation reminds me of
          <a href="https://a.singlediv.com/">this website</a>, which shows art
          only through a single div element with CSS and minimal HTML.
